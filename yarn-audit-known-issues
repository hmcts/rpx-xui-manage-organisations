This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path =

The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive.\n\nThis makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions (see below) it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\n### Affected users\n\nThe impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means.\n\nThe PBKDF2-based JWE Key Management Algorithm Identifiers are\n\n- `PBES2-HS256+A128KW`\n- `PBES2-HS384+A192KW`\n- `PBES2-HS512+A256KW`\n\ne.g.\n\n```js\nconst secret = new Uint8Array(16)\nconst jwe = '...' // JWE from an untrusted party\n\nawait jose.compactDecrypt(jwe, secret)\n```\n\nYou are NOT affected if any of the following applies to you\n\n- Your code does not use the JWE APIs\n- Your code only produces JWE tokens\n- Your code only decrypts JWEs using an asymmetric JWE Key Management Algorithm (this means you're providing an asymmetric key object to the JWE decryption API)\n- Your code only accepts JWEs produced by trusted sources\n- Your code limits the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option not including any of the PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms\n\n### Patches\n\n`v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll users should be able to upgrade given all stable semver major release lines have had new a patch release introduced which limits the PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. This removes the ability to craft JWEs that would consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\nIf users are unable to upgrade their required library version they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms.\n\n- they can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether\n- they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an discussion in the project's [repository](https://github.com/panva/jose/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=GHSA-jv3g-j58f-9mq9%20advisory%20question)\n* Email me at [panva.ip@gmail.com](mailto:panva.ip@gmail.com)\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jv3g-j58f-9mq9"},"1092972":{"findings":[{"version":"2.88.2","paths":["@pact-foundation/pact-node>request","@pact-foundation/pact>@pact-foundation/pact-node>request"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=2.88.2","module_name":"request","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6","cves":["CVE-2023-28155"],"access":"public","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","cvss":{"score":6.1,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},"updated":"2023-08-14T20:53:47.000Z","recommendation":"None","cwe":["CWE-918"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1092972,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28155\n- https://github.com/request/request/issues/3442\n- https://github.com/request/request/pull/3444\n- https://doyensec.com/resources/Doyensec_Advisory_RequestSSRF_Q12023.pdf\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230413-0007/\n- https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2500\n- https://github.com/cypress-io/request/blob/master/lib/redirect.js#L116\n- https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/lib/redirect.js#L111\n- https://github.com/cypress-io/request/pull/28\n- https://github.com/cypress-io/request/commit/c5bcf21d40fb61feaff21a0e5a2b3934a440024f\n- https://github.com/cypress-io/request/releases/tag/v3.0.0\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6","created":"2023-03-16T15:30:19.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Server-Side Request Forgery in Request","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"The `request` package through 2.88.2 for Node.js and the `@cypress/request` package prior to 3.0.0 allow a bypass of SSRF mitigations via an attacker-controller server that does a cross-protocol redirect (HTTP to HTTPS, or HTTPS to HTTP).\n\nNOTE: The `request` package is no longer supported by the maintainer.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6"},"1093639":{"findings":[{"version":"0.4.1","paths":["@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>passport"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<0.6.0","module_name":"passport","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-v923-w3x8-wh69","cves":["CVE-2022-25896"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=0.6.0","cvss":{"score":4.8,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"},"updated":"2023-09-11T16:22:18.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.6.0 or later","cwe":["CWE-384"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1093639,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25896\n- https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport/pull/900\n- https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport/commit/7e9b9cf4d7be02428e963fc729496a45baeea608\n- https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PASSPORT-2840631\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v923-w3x8-wh69","created":"2022-07-02T00:00:19.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Passport vulnerable to session regeneration when a users logs in or out","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"This affects the package passport before 0.6.0.

This is because it both (1) defaults to [SHA1][SHA1 wiki], a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure [since at least 2005][Cryptanalysis of SHA-1] and (2) defaults to [one single iteration][one iteration src], a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to [preimage][preimage attack] and [collision][collision attack] attacks.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\n1.

[For at most $45,000][SHA1 is a Shambles], an attacker, given control of only the beginning of a crypto-js PBKDF2 input, can create a value which has _identical cryptographic signature_ to any chosen known value.\n4. Due to the [length extension attack] on SHA1, we can create a value that has identical signature to any _unknown_ value, provided it is prefixed by a known value. It does not matter if PBKDF2 applies '[salt][cryptographic salt]' or '[pepper][cryptographic pepper]' or any other secret unknown to the attacker. It will still create an identical signature.\n\n[cryptographic salt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography) \"Salt (cryptography), Wikipedia\"\n[cryptographic pepper]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography) \"Pepper (cryptography), Wikipedia\"\n[SHA1 wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1 \"SHA-1, Wikipedia\"\n[Cryptanalysis of SHA-1]: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html \"Cryptanalysis of SHA-1\"\n[one iteration src]: https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/blob/1da3dabf93f0a0435c47627d6f171ad25f452012/src/pbkdf2.js#L22-L26 \"crypto-js/src/pbkdf2.js lines 22-26\"\n[collision attack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision \"Collision Attack, Wikipedia\"\n[preimage attack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack \"Preimage Attack, Wikipedia\"\n[SHA1 is a Shambles]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf \"SHA-1 is a Shambles: First Chosen-Prefix Collision on SHA-1\nand Application to the PGP Web of Trust, Gaëtan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin\"\n[Length Extension attack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack \"Length extension attack, Wikipedia\"\n\ncrypto-js has 10,642 public users [as displayed on NPM][crypto-js, NPM], today October 11th 2023.

This code has been the same since crypto-js was first created.\n\n#### Further Cryptanalysis\n\nThe issue here is especially egregious because the length extension attack makes useless any secret that might be appended to the plaintext before calculating its signature.\n\nConsider a scheme in which a secret is created for a user's username, and that secret is used to protect e.g. their passwords. Let's say that password is 'fake-password', and their username is 'example-username'.\n\nTo encrypt the user password via symmetric encryption we might do `encrypt(plaintext: 'fake-password', encryption_key: cryptojs.pbkdf2(value: 'example username' + salt_or_pepper))`. By this means, we would, in theory, create an `encryption_key` that can be determined from the public username, but which requires the secret `salt_or_pepper` to generate. This is a common scheme for protecting passwords, as exemplified in bcrypt & scrypt. Because the encryption key is symmetric, we can use this derived key to also decrypt the ciphertext.\n\nBecause of the length extension issue, if the attacker obtains (via attack 1), a collision with 'example username', the attacker _does not need to know_ `salt_or_pepper` to decrypt their account data, only their public username.\n\n### Description\n\nPBKDF2 is a key-derivation is a key-derivation function that is used for two main purposes: (1) to stretch or squash a variable length password's entropy into a fixed size for consumption by another cryptographic operation and (2) to reduce the chance of downstream operations recovering the password input (for example, for password storage).\n\nUnlike the modern [webcrypto](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#pbkdf2-operations) standard, crypto-js does not throw an error when a number of iterations is not specified, and defaults to one single iteration. In the year 2000, when PBKDF2 was originally specified, the minimum number of iterations suggested was set at 1,000. Today, [OWASP recommends 1,300,000][OWASP PBKDF2 Cheatsheet]:\n\nhttps://github.com/brix/crypto-js/blob/4dcaa7afd08f48cd285463b8f9499cdb242605fa/src/pbkdf2.js#L22-L26\n\n### Patches\nNo available patch. The package is not maintained.\n\n### Workarounds\nConsult the [OWASP PBKDF2 Cheatsheet]. Configure to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.\n\n### Coordinated disclosure\nThis issue was simultaneously submitted to [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) and [crypto-es](https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es) on the 23rd of October 2023.\n\n### Caveats\n\nThis issue was found in a security review that was _not_ scoped to crypto-js. This report is not an indication that crypto-js has undergone a formal security assessment by the author.\n\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf"},"1095001":{"findings":[{"version":"2.6.3","paths":["@hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck>@hmcts/nodejs-logging>winston>async","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-ts-auto-mock>ts-auto-mock>winston>async"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=2.0.0

Complexity","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\n* using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs\n* noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters\n* users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks\n\n### Patches\nThe problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn general, given the proliferation of ReDoS attacks, it makes sense to limit the length of the user input to something sane, like 200 characters or less. I haven't seen legitimate cases of date-time strings longer than that, so all moment users who do pass a user-originating string to constructor are encouraged to apply such a rudimentary filter, that would help with this but also most future ReDoS vulnerabilities.\n\n### References\nThere is an excellent writeup of the issue here: https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973=\n\n### Details\nThe issue is rooted in the code that removes legacy comments (stuff inside parenthesis) from strings during rfc2822 parsing. `moment(\"(\".repeat(500000))` will take a few minutes to process, which is unacceptable.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g"},"1095073":{"findings":[{"version":"2.6.1","paths":["node-fetch","isomorphic-fetch>node-fetch"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<2.6.7","module_name":"node-fetch","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-r683-j2x4-v87g","cves":["CVE-2022-0235"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=2.6.7","cvss":{"score":8.8,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"updated":"2023-11-29T22:08:39.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade

All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"},"1095112":{"findings":[{"version":"6.0.5","paths":["@pact-foundation/pact-node>tar","@pact-foundation/pact>@pact-foundation/pact-node>tar","playwright>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@pact-foundation/pact-node>bunyan>dtrace-provider>node-gyp>tar","@pact-foundation/pact-node>bunyan>dtrace-provider>nan>node-gyp>tar","@pact-foundation/pact>@pact-foundation/pact-node>bunyan>dtrace-provider>nan>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>@jest/core>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>@jest/core>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>@jest/globals>@jest/expect>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>@jest/core>jest-resolve-dependencies>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>jest-cli>@jest/core>jest-resolve-dependencies>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>@jest/core>jest-runtime>@jest/globals>@jest/expect>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>@jest/core>jest-runner>jest-runtime>@jest/globals>@jest/expect>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>jest-cli>@jest/core>jest-runner>jest-runtime>@jest/globals>@jest/expect>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>jest-mock-axios>jest>jest-cli>@jest/core>jest-config>jest-runner>jest-runtime>@jest/globals>@jest/expect>jest-snapshot>@jest/transform>jest-haste-map>fsevents>node-gyp>tar"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=6.0.0 <6.1.9","module_name":"tar","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p","cves":["CVE-2021-37712"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=6.1.9","cvss":{"score":8.2,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"},"updated":"2023-11-29T22:27:02.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 6.1.9 or later","cwe":["CWE-22","CWE-59"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1095112,"references":"- https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37712\n- https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html\n- https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008\n- https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html\n- https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/1739408d3122af897caefd09662bce2ea477533b\n- https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/b6162c7fafe797f856564ef37f4b82747f051455\n- https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/bb93ba243746f705092905da1955ac3b0509ba1e\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p","created":"2021-08-31T16:05:17.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory cache poisoning using symbolic links","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.

Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh"},"1095126":{"findings":[{"version":"0.8.4","paths":["git-rev-sync>shelljs"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<0.8.5","module_name":"shelljs","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-4rq4-32rv-6wp6","cves":["CVE-2022-0144"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=0.8.5","cvss":{"score":7.1,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2023-11-29T22:21:11.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.8.5 or later","cwe":["CWE-269"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1095126,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0144\n- https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs/commit/d919d22dd6de385edaa9d90313075a77f74b338c\n- https://huntr.dev/bounties/50996581-c08e-4eed-a90e-c0bac082679c\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4rq4-32rv-6wp6","created":"2022-01-21T23:37:28.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Improper Privilege Management in shelljs","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"shelljs is vulnerable to Improper Privilege Management","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4rq4-32rv-6wp6"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":53,"high":136,"critical":17},"dependencies":836,"devDependencies":8,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":844}}
